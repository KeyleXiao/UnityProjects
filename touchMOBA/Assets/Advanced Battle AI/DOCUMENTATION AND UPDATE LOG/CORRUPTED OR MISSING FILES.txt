If you are missing any files, or if any PlayMaker FSMs are corrupted or "missing" then something went wrong
during the download / import process.  If that happens, and you've already tried importing it into a blank project
a 2nd time, we can email you a complete package with all settings intact.

1) Send us an email at aibotsystem@gmail.com or use the contact form on our website: www.AIBotSystem.com

2) Let us know your problem (e.g. Missing Files)

3) Let us know your Unity Invoice number (starts with "OR...") so we can verify you before sending you
a product download.

If you purchased this from our website (aibotsystem.com) instead of the Unity Asset Store,
simply give us the receipt or transaction number on your receipt.

4) Wait for us to email you back soon with a download link! (Shouldn't take longer than 24-48 hours unless we
are very busy)
