We understand that the newer PlayMaker versions have some of the add-ons included.
We are still leaving the "PlayMaker Addons" folder in this package and using them
in case some users' projects still depend on older PlayMaker versions.

We have not heard of any issues from our users on leaving the addons in the package.
