If your import process generated errors, such as Missing Tags, "Undefined Tags" or Undefined input,
you can either try to reimport, or replace your project settings with the ones in the PROJECT SETTINGS.zip file.

The reason for this is because not all settings are uploaded to the Unity Asset Store when we publish our product.

Please see the image file, "ADD THESE TAGS.jpg" for a list of tags to get the demo scenes working.

Remember, only do this to a new blank project!  This will overwrite existing project tags and input settings.
