++ ADD-ON FOR "ADVANCED BATTLE AI" ++

ADD-ON NAME: BotNameDisplayTag

ADD-ON AUTHOR: www.AIBotSystem.com

FUNCTIONALITY: Adds a name tag on top of the bot at run time.

MIN REQUIREMENTS: 
	1) Unity Free Edition, 4.5+
	2) PlayMaker 1.7+ (not included)
	3) Instant AI Bots for PlayMaker (not included)





REQUIRES THE FOLLOWING FSMs AND VARIABLE NAMES (should be already setup in original package):

1) charSTAT_Name (FSM Identity)


INSTALLATION:  Simply drop this entire folder into the "INSTANT AI BOTS for PLAYMAKER / Addons" folder


Basically, if you purchased the Instant AI Bots package and did not change any core FSM variable names, then you should be all set!


HOW TO USE:  Add the .DLL in this folder as a component to the Bot gameobject.  Must be on the same parent object level as all the FSMs.  Then drag a camera object into the field, Gui Camera.  Without a camera, the name tag WILL NOT DISPLAY and will trigger GUI errors.

Set AutoUpdate to true if you want the name tag constantly updated.  This is necessary if you have a dynamic name tag.

Thank you for purchasing! Hope you enjoy.
