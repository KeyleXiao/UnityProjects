This camera tour system is provided as a free bonus! It is otherwise available for purchase on the Unity Asset Store.  
Note: The system available on the Asset Store might have enhanced features that are more updated than this one. 

WHAT IT DOES: It allows a camera in your scene to automatically fly around smoothly, giving your user a "tour" of the scene.  This is great for cut-scenes, cinematics, and game demos.  It's also very useful if you are an artist and you have environment products to sell on the Asset Store and want a fast, easy solution for showcasing your beautiful environments!

HOW TO USE: 
	1) Drag the Camera Tour System prefab onto the scene.
	2) Inside the Camera Tour System prefab, find Camera Route.
	3) Select the waypoints and drag them around to built your camera route.
	4) Feel free to delete or add more waypoints. They must be child objects of the Camera Route parent.

	5) Add the CameraTours script component to your camera.
	6) Drag the "Camera Route" parent object into the waypoint slot in your camera.
	7) Drag the "Camera Focus" child object into the focus slot in your camera.
	8) Drag the "Camera Focus" child object around the scene to your liking.  This object determines the location your camera will always look at while flying around.
